# Algorithms Simplified

## By the Web & Coding Club IIT Bombay

Greetings from the Web & Coding Club!

Short videos trivially explaining some mind-blowing yet intuitive algorithms will be shared on a weekly basis. This is a series where we **do not require you to code**. You can just watch a 15-20 min video to learn something cool, thatâ€™s it!
